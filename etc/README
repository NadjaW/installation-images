Create a boot disk
------------------

All kernels are modularized. This means that almost all drivers are loaded
as kernel modules.

You can create a new boot/install floppy if you have access to either a
running Linux box or a running DOS box.

Under DOS, write it to a formatted (i.e. error-free) 1.44MB-floppy using
CD1:/dosutils/rawrite/rawrite.exe. For Windows systems there is
CD1:/dosutils/rawwritewin/rawwritewin.exe.

Under Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=bootdisk of=/dev/fd0u1440

Now you have a new boot/install floppy which you can use to boot either the
installed system or the rescue system from CD.

In addition to a boot disk you will also need modules disk 1!



Create a modules disk
---------------------

Only a few modules fit on the bootdisk. Therefore five modules floppies
exist. If you do not find the driver for your hardware on the normal disk,
just insert the appropriate modules disk as soon as linuxrc starts.

Choose one of the modules disk images in this directory according to the
list below.

Under Windows/DOS, use rawrite as descibed in 'Create a boot disk'. Under
Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=modules1 of=/dev/fd0u1440

Of course you would replace 'modules1' with the image name you want.

modules1:  USB modules.

modules2:  IDE/RAID/SCSI modules.

modules3:  Network modules.

modules4:  PCMCIA, FireWire (IEEE1394), file system and more SCSI modules.

modules5:  Old (non-ATAPI) CDROM drivers.

See modules[12345].txt for a detailed listing.



Create a rescue floppy
----------------------

There is already a rescue system on CD. But in case you cannot access the CD
or you just want a smaller rescue system, you can create a rescue floppy.

Under Windows/DOS, use rawrite as descibed in 'Create a boot disk'. Under
Linux, use a command like

  cd /where_CD1_is_mounted/boot
  dd if=rescuefloppy of=/dev/fd0u1440



What are the other files in this directory?
-------------------------------------------

rescue:    (Large) rescue system.

root:      Installation system.

loader:    Boot loader and files it needs.
