; module line format:
; module,description,parameter,pre_install,post_install,initrd,auto
;
; Notes:
;   (1)  descriptions starting with '-' are dropped
;   (2)  lines with descriptions starting with '--' are dropped (but the
;        modules are added to the section)
;   (3)  a parameter starting with '-' indicates that linuxrc should never
;        prompt the user for module params, even in manual mode; instead, this
;        param (without the '-' is used)
;   (4)  modules starting with '-' are not added, but the config entry is kept
;   (5)  module dependencies are added to pre_install automatically
;   (6)  don't assign a module to more than one section (with the exception of
;        'cd1' and 'autoload')
;   (7)  you can have modules in section 'autoload' _and_ in another section;
;        it will be auomatically loaded and be available via menu in linuxrc,
;        too in this case
;   (8)  section 'cd1' holds the list of modules that are put on CD1; they
;        are loaded by yast, if necessary and don't need any special config
;        line
;   (9)  A section, MoreModules and ModuleClass may have "@label" in it.
;        Both are removed in the final config. This can be used to split a
;        section into several parts.
;  (10)  ModDisk=n,m means: it goes to disk n but linuxrc will ask for disk m.
;
; (1) is mostly a comment; (2) + (4) are useful for af_packet.o (it will be
; automatically loaded after the network modules disk has been read); (3) is
; useful e.g. for modules that don't accept parameters.
